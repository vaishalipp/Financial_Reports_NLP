We resumed limited operations in the International markets in early June 2020 and limited operations in the U.S. markets in late August 2020.

In the meantime, however, a continued high level of COVID-19 cases, together with continuing delays of major movie releases and the direct or simultaneous release of movie titles to the home video or streaming markets in lieu of theatre exhibition, have led to theatre closures, prevented the opening of theatres in major markets and have had, and are expected to continue to have in the future, a material adverse impact on theatre attendance levels and our business.',\n",

Currently, our reopened theatres are generating only a small portion of the attendance and revenue from admissions and food and beverage sales compared to historical levels and our cash burn is higher than when theatres were closed. The extent of our cash burn in the future will primarily be dependent on attendance, which drives admission, food and beverage, and other revenue. The ultimate duration of the pandemic is uncertain, and we may need to suspend existing theatre operations or extend the suspension of operations at theatres that are currently closed. We cannot predict with certainty when or if our business will return to closer to normal levels. In addition, governmental officials may impose further restrictions on travel or introduce additional social distancing measures such as further limiting the number of people allowed in a theatre at any given time.

Some movie studios have also reduced or eliminated the theatrical exclusive release window or have skipped a theatrical release and released their movies through streaming or other channels, or have announced that future theatrical releases will be released concurrently through streaming channels, and studios may continue to do so with additional releases for the duration of the pandemic and after the pandemic has subsided.

       " 'Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets. The most attended films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holidays, making our business seasonal. We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, the choice by distributors to release fewer feature-length movies theatrically, or the choice to release feature-length movies directly to video streaming or PVOD platforms could hurt our business and results of operations. Conversely, the successful performance of these motion pictures, particularly the sustained success of any one motion picture, or an increase in effective marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, may generate positive results for our business and operations in a specific fiscal quarter or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, future results of operations. As movie studios rely on a smaller number of higher grossing “tent pole” films there may be increased pressure for higher film licensing fees. Our loyalty program and certain promotional pricing also may affect performance and increase the cost to license motion pictures relative to revenue for admission. In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios and the theatrical exclusive release window may adversely affect the demographic base of movie-goers.',\n",
       " 'Our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate. Competitors may be multi-national circuits, national circuits, regional circuits or smaller independent exhibitors. Competition among theatre exhibition companies is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, terms for licensing of motion pictures and availability and securing and maintaining desirable locations.',\n",

We also compete for the public’s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, amusement parks, live music concerts, live theatre, and restaurants. An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment could reduce attendance at our theatres, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.',\n",

Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Moreover, in the event of changes to applicable law, including the termination of the consent decrees (see the Regulatory Environment section in Part I, Item 1 “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), these practices may change ways that cannot be predicted. Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films or to obtain licenses at all.

Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain movie studios have adopted strategies that have eliminated the theatrical exclusive release window. Notably, Warner Bros. announced that its entire studio film slate for 2021 will move to simultaneous release. In other cases, movie studios such as Disney have released (and have indicated an intention in certain cases to continue to release) movie titles directly to the in-home and streaming channels, avoiding a theatrical release. Other studios may adopt a similar strategy and these adjustments due to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to permanent changes that shorten or eliminate the theatrical exclusive release window.

Some European licenses use a per capita agreement instead, paying a flat amount per ticket, where the sum is agreed in long-term agreements in advance of the film showing. Under an aggregate terms formula, we usually pay the distributor a specified percentage of box office gross or pay based on a scale of percentages tied to different amounts of box office gross, or in Europe, we pay based on the number of weeks since release.

Prior to the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we had an operating “float” which partially financed our operations and which generally permitted us to maintain a smaller amount of working capital capacity. This float existed because admissions revenues are received in cash, while exhibition costs (primarily film rentals) are ordinarily paid to distributors from 20 to 45\\xa0days following receipt of box office admissions revenues. Film distributors generally release the films which they anticipate will be the most successful during the summer and year-end holiday seasons.

Similarly, it is very difficult to predict when theatre attendance levels will normalize, which we expect will depend on the widespread availability and use of effective vaccines for the coronavirus. However, our current cash burn rates are not sustainable. Further, we cannot predict what  future changes may occur to the supply or release date of movie titles available for theatrical exhibition once moviegoers are prepared to return in large numbers.

We estimated future attendance levels and other assumptions to predict our liquidity requirements and future cash burn but our ability to accurately predict our liquidity and cash burn is uncertain due to the unknown magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
